# CoordCalcFromOffset
Spreadsheet to calculate New Coordinates given a static offset (mainly intended for use with FiveM scripting but could work for other purposes too)

-Note: The .ods file is for libreoffice/opendocuments and the .xlsx file is for excel (thought I would add that in case anyone for some reason doesn't know that, though I would be surprised)

# Instructions/Info
- Put the offset values in the x, y, z cells of the row that says "Offset In (xyz)" under the corresponding columns.
- Put the coordinates you want to apply the offset to in the x, y, z cells of row that says "Coords In (xyz)" under the corresponding columns
- The new coordinates with the offset applied to them will be in the x, y, z cells of the row that says "Coords Out (xyz)".

Hopefully this is of some use to someone, made it today and thought I would share it :D
